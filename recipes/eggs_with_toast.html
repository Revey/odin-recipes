    <h2>Descrption</h2>
    <p> I eat this meal almost every morning. This meal
        consist of a little over 300 calories. I focus mainly on
        getting a good amount of protein to start off my day. Since this meal
        focuses mainly on a low calorie but high protein route it contains barely any fat
        and mainly protien and carbs.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Liquid Egg Whites (230 grams)</li>
        <li>One whole egg</li>
        <li>Toast (2 slices)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the egg with the egg white</li>
        <li>Heat up a pan on medium and spray with pan oil spray (using oil spray keeps the amount of calories from oil to a minumum)</li>
